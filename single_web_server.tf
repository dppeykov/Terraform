# GOAL: deploy a single web server in an EC2 Instance that responds to HTTP requests

# On Unix-like operating systems, the nohup command executes another command, and instructs the system to continue running it even if the session is disconnected.
# busybox - utility installed by default on all ubuntu servers that can fire up a web server and serve a file

  }
}

# <<-EOF and EOF are Terraformâ€™s heredoc syntaxwhich allows you to create multiline strings without having to insert newline characters all over the place

# By default AWS does not allow any incoming or outgoing traffic from an EC2 Instance - we need a security group to allow that

# Just creating a security group is not enough - we need to tell the servet to use it by passing the ID of the security group into the vpc_security_group_ids argument of the aws_instance resource.
